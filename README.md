Project title: ChatBot;

Project description: In our project we explore how a chatbot can give information to students about academic-related information. In the first iteration of the project we created a chatbot for giving
students information about where to get coffee etc. at IFI. One of our hypothesis was that
information given by chatbots would be useful for new students at IFI, giving them
information about things that we consider to be important when youâ€™re a first year students.
In the second iteration we wanted to explore the use of chatbots through theory and used
this in combination with testing to learn more about how a chatbot for this context should
be. In the final iteration, iteration three, we improved and changed the chatbot based on the
results from the last iteration and made a plan for evaluate the chatbot. The plan was then
executed with five participants. In our conclusion we discuss the results from the evaluation
in the light of our research question.

Technologies are used : Microsoft Azure AI + Machine Learning, Web Apps with basics of front end like HTML, CSS, Javascript.
